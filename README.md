# Sentiment Analysis for COVID-19 Vaccines
Collected real-time data using the Twitter API and performed data cleaning and preprocessing. Applied NLP techniques including tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization to extract meaningful features. Implemented K-Means clustering to categorize tweets into three sentiment groups and built an interactive analysis dashboard using Flask to visualize insights through charts.
